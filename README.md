# Traffic sign detection using CNN and data augmentation

Project focuses on Traffic Sign Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with a key emphasis on data augmentation. Leveraging CNNs, we've developed an accurate and robust traffic sign detection system capable of recognizing various sign types. Data augmentation techniques boost the model's performance and adaptability by generating diverse training samples. Our approach enhances road safety and traffic management by improving real-time traffic sign recognition.
